<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

   <p>
   In this project I didn't have so many problems, they were easy to solve and follow, to be honest. The biggest challenges came during the development of version 2.0, which I      wil talk about.
   In this version, I added good programming practices, making more readable, easier to understand and maintain, with methods, features, new widgets and styles. <br>
